Hi I'm Daison Cari√±o,

A (PH) Filipino citizen, currently working as Backend PHP Engineer, I could also work as DevOps wherein I could handle unix servers and physical network design, even handling web services such as AWS, digital ocean and more.

I don't have any specific web framework, I can understand how framework works how their core components works, from Zend/Symfony/Laravel and even Phalcon Framework.

An architect when it comes to designing classes which I don't rely on framework objects but instead an adapter classes which I could easily migrate from one another without hammering those codes, I follow PSR standards and also self-explanatory code.

**TL;DR; you can read my posts to reach me.**

Enjoy!
