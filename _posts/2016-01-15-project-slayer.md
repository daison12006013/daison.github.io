## The Project

Are you aware that there is a [Phalcon Framework](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon)? It is written using Zephir Language, it compiles ``.zep`` files into C/C++ Language and it will automatically compile and export as ``.so`` that turns out as PHP Extension file, this extension is much more faster.

However, creating from scratch using Phalcon takes time. That's why we built this project [phalconslayer](https://github.com/phalconslayer/slayer) which wraps/re-structures the existing Phalcon classes into a well and configurable, we've also imported the most well known dependency manager **Composer**

##### The project itself uses some extensive packages, such as:
- Flysystem
- Monolog
- Symfony Components
- Blade Template
- Faker Factory
- Phinx Migration
- Mailgun / Mandrill mail drivers
- Modular request using Guzzle
- Tactician for Middleware
- Mail Template Inliner
- and many more...
