While browsing new trends, I found this repository [https://github.com/tagua-vm/tagua-vm](https://github.com/tagua-vm/tagua-vm). Basically a new virtual machine that interprets your PHP file code.

We know we have the most well known ``Zend Engine`` and also Facebook's ``HHVM``.

But this **vm** main purpose is for Safety cases, you could probably review their full ReadMe file for more detailed information, while it is still under development you could probably build your own for testing purposes.
